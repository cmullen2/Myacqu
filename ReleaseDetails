Acqu-System:
-- Build details are included in README.md

This release version of the A2-AcquSystem has user data directories to deal with:
- acqu_user/data.MC      -- Monte Carlo data processed through A2-Geant4 
- acqu_user/data.2008.12 -- Linearly polarised data, unpol. proton target, taken in December 2008 
- acqu_user/data.2012.12 -- Linearly polarised data, unpol. proton target, taken in December 2012 
- acqu_user/data.TaggEff -- Tagging Efficiency files
- acqu_user/data.2013.06 -- this has not been tested by me but is included (Mk2)

Fixed:
- Veto time on TAPS was set to -time (to match the normal calibration output of Basel-Calib code).
- Fixed TAPS config file as the old (TAPS2009) config files were still being used.
- Protons were not being detected in previous release versions, this is fixed.

Known Problems:
- None.
