A quick how-to for new users: AcquRoot
======================================
Author: Cristina Collicott

Some Basics:
- Details on how to build AcquRoot are given in README.md. When first installing Acqu, and after making changes to any source code, AcquRoot must be rebuilt.
- The Acqu code is divided into two sections (acqu_core and acqu_user). The majority of code required for users is contained in acqu_user. 
- Contained in the acqu_user directory is a set of example "data" directories (ex. data.2012.12, data.2008.12, data.MC ....) 
  Each directory contains configuration files for a specific beam time, or simulated data (data.MC), or tagging efficiencies (data.TaggEff).
  The config files are used to define the files to be anaylsed, the apparatus/detector/physics classes to use, and the defined histograms to save.


Getting Started (setting up your config files):
- Go to your acqu_user directory
- To work within a specific data directory, create a symbolic link within acqu_user called "data" which points to the specific data directory
  ex. > ln -s data.MC data
- The first file in the acqu-hierarchy is named AR.dat:
	- For MC data, AR.dat declares the file to be analysed.
	- For real data, a server file AR-Server.dat is defined, and must be editted to point to the real data files.
	  "File-Directory:" should point to the directory where real data is stored
	  "File-Name:" add individual files to the server list. With 0 0 appended to the end of the line, the full file is analysed.
- The second file is named AR-Analysis.dat:
	- Here all apparatus classes (and their config files) are defined. Just turn a detector off by commenting it out.
	  Apparatus classes will call the individual parts of the apparatus (ex. CentralApparatus calls NaI, PID and MWPC). 
	  Follow the apparatus class config files to turn individual detector components on/off.
	- A physics class can be defined (ex TA2Pi0Compton).
	- A finish macro, which saves the defined histograms into a root file, and closes tree files.
	- A period macro, which periodically outputs the number of analysed events to the terminal.
- Finally edit any defined apparatus/detector/physics class you've turned on in the AR-Analysis.dat file


Running AcquRoot:
- To see which files are turned on, you can run the AcquHierarchy command:
  > AcquHierarchy AR.dat
- To actually run AcquRoot, run the following command from inside your acqu_user directory:
  > AcquRoot AR.dat
